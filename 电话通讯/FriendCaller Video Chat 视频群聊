没用过，不知道好不好
各位請小心，這個app要比錢。。好似skype 咁。寫一大段野睇到你火都黎，不是好似viber咁樣不收費
can move the app to SD card; it's like Skype, u still hav to pay in order to make calls to phones... And not many people use it
Good app,free international calls and we can pop up credit by just downloading certain games specified, so we have continuous supplied credit.great!

Cant use it. Says you are offline even I have the wifi connection. I am using droid pro. shi wang!
Cool app I used FriendCaller on my PC and iPod touch. Is very cool app, I can send links that my friends can open and talk to me. They don't have to sign up or install software, is sort of a browser phone. And now on Android, pretty cool
很实用，免费打国际长途
